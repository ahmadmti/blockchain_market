                    An NFT is a digital asset stored on the blockchain. These assets hold information, like descriptions, properties, and media files. NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind, and non-interchangeable.
                    <br />
                    The history of every NFT is recorded on the blockchain, meaning buyers can prove their ownership and creators can receive creator earnings every time their work is re-sold. NFTs can be traded on marketplaces, proudly displayed in online galleries or used to access exclusive content and real-life experiences.
